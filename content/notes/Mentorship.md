Effective team collaboration and leadership is super important! In my own projects I document all my work carefully using Obsidian. 

I've provided mentorship through the [Foothills SLI institute](https://www.losaltosonline.com/schools/science-learning-institute-offers-internships-with-pathway-to-stem/article_8056c754-b564-11ec-ad82-4b544bbeb2ef.html), SREIP, and the Stanford Science Fellowship.
